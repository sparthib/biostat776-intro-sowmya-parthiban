# Welcome! Here's a little something about me:

My name is Sowmya Parthiban. I am a Biomedical Engineering grad student 
at JHU. I work with the JHU Biostats deparment in spatial transcriptomics research for neurodegenerative disorders. I primarily used to work with python for reinforcement learning research, but as I've found myself gravitated towards Biostatistics, I've slowly replaced that with R since it's widely used in the field. 

## Fun facts!

  1. I am a salsa dancer! Dancing's one of my greatest passions in life. 
  
  2. I love listening to songs from different countries - according to Spotify, it was 54 countries last year.
  
  3. I tried an outdoor yoga class for the first time recently and it was a highly refreshing experience - I see myself doing it more ofter in the future. 
  
  4. Currently reading Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. 
  
  5. My favorite food is beer-battered shrimp tacos!

## This is cool: 

  Justin Baldoni's an actor/producer who's been very active in 
  breaking down toxic masculinity and gender norms in  society through his TV shows as well as his podcast [Man Enough](https://manenough.com/podcast/)  and I think it's very cool. As far as I know, not enough men put themselves out there and talk about it.
